          Growing up, I never saw myself sitting behind my laptop almost the
          whole day every day. I was one of those kids who didnâ€™t know exactly
          what they wanted. But Getting into the Junior High and Senior High
          School level, I realised one of the subjects I effortlessly excelled
          in was Information Communication and Technology.

          During my Junior High School days, I represented my school in various
          quiz competitions around that time and mostly came out as winner. All
          that while, I still didnâ€™t consider pursuing it as a career. When it
          came to the point of choosing a course to study in the university,
          among other things, I added a computer-related course maybe because I
          thought it always came easy to me.

          After our first summer vacation, a friend of mine showed me a cool
          website (flight booking site) she built using HTML and CSS (it was
          just the interfaceðŸ˜‚). I was so intrigued and wide-eyed when she
          showed me the code behind what we were seeing. That was when I decided
          to learn how to code. I went ahead and enrolled in a Bootcamp

          because of how much I understood coding can improve businesses and
          lives in general.
